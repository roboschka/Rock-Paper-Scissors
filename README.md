# Rock-Paper-Scissors
a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML/CSS and JavaScript
This mini side project I did because I was thinking about creating a web game and as it turns out freeCodeCamp did a video about this game (go check them out!).

Fortunately managed to finish this game in a couple hours right before I had to do my assignment :)
